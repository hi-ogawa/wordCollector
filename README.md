# Word Collector with Screenshot

You can learn vocabularies by collecting words associated with screenshot images.
But, I'm the only one who can use this service for now
(you can only see what I've collected from [here](http://often-test-app.xyz:3005/)).

## Motivation

I was once collecting vocabularies I met on a TV show or any other english texts by using [Vocabulary.com](http://www.vocabulary.com/), like [here](http://www.vocabulary.com/profiles/B099P5N1XM0XCR).
At that time, first I took screenshots everytime I met new words on the web,
then on weekends I reviewed the words on those pictures and register them to Vocabulary.com.
I found that procedure was very tadius, so I started making this application,
which enables the tadius process automatically done.

## How it works

- from Chrome extension:

- from iPhone with jailbreak apps:

## How it is implemented

- Server (Ruby on Rails)
- Client (Chrome extension)

## Futue functions or fixes

- implement user management
- publish the chrome extension
- register iphone developer and learn how to make app extension properly (not jailbreak way)
- make it work on production mode instead of development mode
- fix odd port number
